# Hi teacher or student :)!
# I had some issues in writing the new_game() function
# and I got stuck on it, so it is not working according 
# to proffesor's indications. I'm sorry for this.
# If you have some pieces of advice on how the code should look,
# please share in general comments section :).
# Thanks in advance!
